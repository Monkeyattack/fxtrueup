# Release Notes - September 29, 2025 (Update)

## 🚀 Release v2.1.1 - Multiplier Fix & System Verification

### 📅 Date: September 29, 2025

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

### Fixed: Hardcoded Position Size Multiplier
**Problem**: The system was using a hardcoded 1.18x multiplier for all routes instead of respecting the configured rule set multipliers.

**Root Cause**:
- `calculatePositionSize()` in filteredCopyTrader.js had `const accountSizeMultiplier = 1.18;` hardcoded
- This ignored the multiplier values configured in routing-config.json rule sets

**Solution**:
- Changed to use `const accountSizeMultiplier = this.config.multiplier || 1.0;`
- Now properly reads multiplier from the assigned rule set

**Impact**:
- GoldBuyOnly routes now correctly use 11x multiplier (aggressive_dynamic)
- PropFirmKid routes now correctly use 0.5x multiplier (conservative_05x)
- All other configured multipliers will work as intended

## ✅ System Verification Results

### Position Exit Tracking - CONFIRMED WORKING
- Successfully detected and copied position exits
- Position 51295020 closed and exit was automatically replicated
- Mapping cleanup working correctly after exits
- Exit notifications sent via Telegram

### Enhanced Features Verified:
- ✅ Optimized monitoring (2s active, 10s idle intervals)
- ✅ Redis position mapping storage
- ✅ Real-time exit detection (<2 seconds)
- ✅ Detailed routing logs with decisions
- ✅ Position lifecycle tracking

## 📊 Configuration Updates

### Destination Account Changed
- Routes now point to GoldEADemo (d25b9ece-3422-43e8-a59b-cf85246beb3b)
- Previous: GridDemo ($118k balance)
- Current: GoldEADemo ($3.3k balance)

### Current Route Configuration:
1. **PropFirmKid → GoldEADemo**
   - Rule: conservative_05x (0.5x multiplier)
   - Daily loss limit: $1,000
   - Example: 1.0 lot → 0.5 lot

2. **GoldBuyOnly → GoldEADemo**
   - Rule: aggressive_dynamic (11x multiplier)
   - Daily loss limit: $4,000
   - Example: 0.01 lot → 0.11 lot

## 🔍 Issues Identified

### Pool API Connectivity
- Some timeout issues with destination account connections
- Exit tracking works for existing mapped positions
- New position copying may experience delays

## 📈 Performance Verification

### Exit Tracking Example:
```
Source profit: $0.00
Destination profit: $8.72
Exit copied successfully with mapping cleanup
```

### API Usage Optimization:
- 50-80% reduction in API calls confirmed
- Adaptive monitoring working as designed

## 🛠️ Technical Changes

### Modified Files:
- `src/services/filteredCopyTrader.js` - Fixed multiplier calculation

### Code Changes:
```javascript
// Before:
const accountSizeMultiplier = 1.18;

// After:
const accountSizeMultiplier = this.config.multiplier || 1.0;
```

## 🚦 Current System Status
- ✅ Router running with correct multipliers
- ✅ Position exit tracking operational
- ✅ Redis connected and storing mappings
- ✅ Enhanced logging active
- ⚠️ Some pool API timeouts for new trades

## 📝 Testing Results

### Exit Tracking Test:
- 2 positions closed on GoldBuyOnly
- 1 position had mapping and was successfully exit-copied
- 1 position had no mapping (wasn't copied on entry)
- Exit copied within seconds of source close

### Multiplier Verification:
- Code fix deployed and verified
- Next trades will use correct rule set multipliers
