**52% of source trades use martingale - high risk strategy**
- Impact: Single bad sequence could blow the account

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Scalability Risk [MEDIUM]
**Strategy uses up to 23 concurrent positions**
- Impact: May hit broker position limits or margin requirements

## 7. Recommendations

### üî¥ Critical Priority

**Risk Limits**: Set hard stop at 4.5% daily loss
- *Reason: Provides 0.5% buffer before Tiger's 5% daily limit*

### üü† High Priority

**Position Sizing**: Consider reducing scaling factor to 0.5 or lower
- *Reason: Current scaling factor of 0.65 may be too aggressive for martingale strategies*

**Martingale Control**: Limit martingale to 3 levels maximum
- *Reason: Each additional level exponentially increases risk*

**Martingale Control**: Skip martingale sequences near daily calculation time (7-9 PM EST)
- *Reason: Avoid having open martingale sequences during daily loss calculation*

**Monitoring**: Set up real-time drawdown alerts at 2%, 3%, and 4% levels
- *Reason: Early warning system to prevent limit breaches*

### üü° Medium Priority

**Position Sizing**: Implement dynamic position sizing based on daily P&L
- *Reason: Reduce position size by 50% after any loss exceeding 2% of balance*

**Risk Limits**: Implement time-based stops for martingale sequences
- *Reason: Close all martingale positions if not recovered within 4 hours*

**Monitoring**: Track correlation between Gold positions and market volatility
- *Reason: Gold martingale strategies perform poorly in high volatility*

## 8. Implementation Checklist

If proceeding with this strategy, implement these controls:

- [ ] Set scaling factor to 0.65 or lower
- [ ] Configure max single position limit: 2 lots
- [ ] Configure max total exposure limit: 5 lots
- [ ] Implement 4.5% daily loss stop
- [ ] Set up 8% total drawdown stop
- [ ] Limit martingale to 3 levels
- [ ] Configure real-time monitoring alerts at 2%, 3%, and 4% drawdown
- [ ] Implement time-based stops for martingale sequences (4 hours max)
- [ ] Set up position reduction after 2% daily loss
- [ ] Avoid martingale sequences 7-9 PM EST (near daily calculation)
- [ ] Monitor correlation with gold volatility indices
- [ ] Set up automated emergency stop system
- [ ] Test all risk controls in demo first

## 9. Monitoring Dashboard Requirements

Create a real-time dashboard tracking:
- Current daily P&L and distance to 5% limit
- Current drawdown and distance to 12% limit
- Number of open positions and total exposure
- Active martingale sequences and their levels
- Time since last martingale recovery
- Win rate (rolling 20 trades)
- R-multiple performance tracking
- Correlation with VIX and gold volatility
